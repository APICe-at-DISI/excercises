Use the *Test-Driven Development (TDD)* methodology to develop the following.

1. Observe the `DeathNote` interface, understand how it is supposed to work
2. Create an implementation of `DeathNote` in which each method throws an Exception
2. Write a test for the class (the test will fail and that is okay) that:

**Important notes**:
* the current time measured as seconds since the Unix epoch is available as `System.currentTimeMillis()`.
* the execution of a program can be paused for a given number of milliseconds using `Thread.sleep(long millis)`.
